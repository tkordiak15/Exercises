The data has been used to create reports and data visualizations like [this](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-spread.html?referringSource=articleShare), and are archived on a GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data). Looking at the README in this repository we read:\n\n> \"We are providing two sets of data with cumulative counts of coronavirus cases and deaths: one with our most current numbers for each geography and another with historical data showing the tally for each day for each geography ... the historical files are the final counts at the end of each day ... The historical and live data are released in three files, one for each of these geographic levels: U.S., states and counties. A smaller file with only the most recent 30 days of data is also available\"\n\nFor this lab we will use the historic, recent, country level data which is stored as an updating CSV at this URL:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties-recent.csv\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Start\n\nI will get you started this week, in the following code chunk, I am attaching the tidyverse package; saving the NY-Times URL as a value called \"url\"; and I am reading that URL into an object called `covid`\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nurl = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties-recent.csv'\ncovid = read_csv(url)\nhead(covid, 5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 5 Ã— 6\n  date       county  state   fips  cases deaths\n  <date>     <chr>   <chr>   <chr> <dbl>  <dbl>\n1 2023-02-22 Autauga Alabama 01001 19732    230\n2 2023-02-22 Baldwin Alabama 01003 69641    724\n3 2023-02-22 Barbour Alabama 01005  7451    112\n4 2023-02-22 Bibb    Alabama 01007  8067    109\n5 2023-02-22 Blount  Alabama 01009 18616    261\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nHint: You can print the top X rows of a `data.frame` with `slice`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nslice(covid, 1:5)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nto print the top 5 columns of the raw covid `object`\n\n## Question 1:\n\nUse `dplyr` verbs to create a data.frame of the **5** counties with the most current cases.
